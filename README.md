# REST Resource
### Simplified Interface for consuming REST APIs
REST Resource is a library to make your life simpler when working with REST API Endpoints. It takes RESTful Resource/Service URIs and simplifies them into a Class that can be called with simple methods. **[Think of it like a Model for REST API Endpoints.](#acts-like-a-model)**

### Features:
- **[Cached Resource Resolution](#cached-resource-resolution)**
  - Call to your resources as if they're already loaded, REST Resource sorts out which ones to GET
- **[Related Resources](#related-resources)**
  - Quickly wire up your Resources and which ones they're related to, REST Resource takes care of the rest
- **[Attribute resolution on Related Resources](#related-attribute-lookups-with-getasync)**
  - Get attributes on related resources as easily as:
    ```javascript
    await resource.getAsync('user.address.city.name')
    // GET /users/1
    // GET /addresses/1
    // GET /cities/1
    // => San Francisco, CA
    ```
- **Class-Based/Custom clients**
  - Completely customize the way REST Resource works with your API
    - [The Client Class](#the-client-class)
    - [Customizing Related Manager](#customizing-relatedmanager)

## What is a REST Resource?
REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems and was first presented by Roy Fielding in 2000 in his famous [dissertation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm).

Like any other architectural style, REST also does have itâ€™s own [6 guiding constraints](https://restfulapi.net/rest-architectural-constraints/) which must be satisfied if an interface needs to be referred as RESTful.

## Examples
[Play around with a working example on JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/ro6fj51n/)

(assuming `Node >= v12.0.0`)

Given the URIs:

```
/users
/users/<id>
/roles
/roles/<id>
/groups
/groups/<id>
```
Code:

```javascript
import Resource from 'rest-resource'

class UserResource extends Resource {
    static endpoint = '/users'

    greet() {
        console.log('I am %s, %s!', this.attributes.name, this.attributes.role)
    }
}

// Sends a GET to /users/123
const arthur = await UserResource.detail(123)
arthur.greet()
// => I am Arthur, King of the Britons!

// Or, get many resources
// Sends a GET to /users
const users = await UserResource.list()

let robin = users.resources[0]
robin.greet()
// => I am Brave Sir Robin, Knight of the Round Table!
console.log(robin.id)
// => 456
robin.set('weapon', 'Sword')
robin.save()
// PATCH { weapon: 'Sword' } to /users/456
```

# Cached Resource Resolution
REST Resource has a caching mechanism that sorts out which resources your app needs and resolves both requirements once that resource has been obtained. In the example below, only one request is made:

```javascript
let user = await UserResource.detail(123)
// GET /users/123

user.greet()
// => I am Arthur, King of the Britons!

let sameuser = await UserResource.detail(123)
// Cache is still good, did not send GET to /users/123

sameuser.greet()
// => I am Arthur, King of the Britons!

console.log(user === sameuser)
// => true
```

If an object has been retrieved and is called upon from other related models, REST Resource will resolve cross-referenced lookups, provided they're made within `n` seconds where `n` is a Resource's `cacheMaxAge`. In the example below, notice the `groups` attribute contains an already-retrieved Group Resource:

```javascript
let arthur = await UserResource.detail(123)
console.log(arthur.attributes)
// => {
//        id: 123,
//        name: 'King Arthur',
//        weapon: 'Sword',
//        role: 1,
//        groups: [1]
//    }

let patsy = await UserResource.detail(654)
console.log(patsy.attributes)
// => {
//        id: 654,
//        name: 'Patsy',
//        weapon: 'Coconuts',
//        role: 2,
//        groups: [1, 2] // Notice this list contains an already retrieved group (1)
//    }

let arthurTitle = arthur.getAsync('role.title')
let arthurGroup = arthur.getAsync('groups.name')
// GET /roles/1
// GET /groups/1

let patsyTitle = patsy.getAsync('role.title')
let patsyGroup = patsy.getAsync('groups.name')
// GET /roles/2
// GET /groups/2
// Does not need to GET /groups/1
```

# Related Resources
Related Resources can be wired up very easily.

## Defining One to Many relationships

```javascript
import Resource from 'rest-resource'

class RoleResource extends Resource {
    static endpont = '/roles'
}

class UserResource extends Resource {
    static endpoint = '/users'
    static related = {
        role: RoleResource
    }
}

let user = await UserResource.detail(321, { getRelated: true }) // Add getRelated: true here and it'll automatically resolve related resources
// GET /users/321
// GET /roles/<id>

// Using get() gets the attribute `title `on related key `role`
let title = user.get('role.title')
let name = user.get('name')
console.log('%s the %s!', name, title)
// => Tim the Enchanter!

console.log(user.get('role'))
// => RoleResource({ id: 654, title: 'Enchanter' })
```

## Defining Many to Many relationships
Many to many relationships work exactly the same as One to Many relationships with one key difference: when using `resource.get(attribute)` where `attribute` is the field of a related resource, the returned value is not the related `Resource` instance, it's a `RelatedManager` instance:

```javascript
class UserResource extends Resource {
    static endpoint = '/users'
    static related = {
        role: RoleResource,
        groups: GroupResource // Many to many relationship
    }
}

let user = await UserResource.detail(654)

console.log(user.attributes)
// => {
//        id: 654,
//        name: 'Patsy',
//        weapon: 'Coconuts',
//        role: 2,
//        groups: [1, 2]
//    }

let manager = user.get('groups') // Many to many relationship

console.log(manager.resolved)
// => false

// REST Resource doesn't automatically resolve related lookups unless instructed by using getRelated
await manager.resolve()
// GET /groups/1
// GET /groups/2

console.log(manager.resolved)
// => true

console.log(manager.objects)
// => [GroupResource, GroupResource]
```

## Using `getRelated()` and `{ getRelated: true }`
When using `ResourceClass.detail()` and `ResourceClass.list()`, one of the available options is `{ getRelated: true }`, which will automatically resolve related resources.

#### Using `{ getRelated: true }` with `ResourceClass.detail()`:
```javascript
let user = await UserResource.detail(654, { getRelated: true })
// GET /users/654
// GET /roles/2
// GET /groups/1
// GET /groups/2
console.log('groups.name')
// => ["Some Group", "Another Group"]
```

#### Using `{ getRelated: true }` with `ResourceClass.list()`:
```javascript
let users = await UserResource.list({ getRelated: true })
// GET /users
// GET /roles/1
// GET /roles/2
// GET /groups/1
// GET /groups/2
```

#### Using `resourceInstance.getRelated()`:

```javascript
let user = await UserResource.detail(654)
// GET /users/654
await user.getRelated()
// GET /roles/2
// GET /groups/1
// GET /groups/2
```

Additionally, you can also provide a list of managers that you want to resolve:
```javascript
let user = await UserResource.detail(654)
// GET /users/654
await user.getRelated(['role']) // Will ignore all but "role" field (notice the "groups" were not resolved)
// GET /roles/2
```

## Related Attribute Lookups with `getAsync()`
REST Resource automatically resolves properties from related lookups, then decides what fields it needs to call `resource.getRelated()`

```javascript
let roger = await UserResource.detail(543)
// GET /users/543

let title = await roger.getAsync('role.title')
// GET /roles/<id>

console.log(title)
// => Shrubber
```

#### Note: `resource.getAsync(attribute)` is one of the most useful features of REST Resource as it allows you to define the fields that are necessary to build your app, and REST Resource will intelligently request only the data it _needs_ from the API!

# Acts like a Model
You can use REST Resource like a RESTful Model. REST Resource tracks changes in each Resource instance's attributes and uses RESTful HTTP Verbs like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` accordingly:

```javascript
let robin = new UserResource({
    name: 'Brave Sir Robin',
    weapon: 'Sword'
})

await robin.save()
// POST /users
let knight = new RoleResource({ title: 'Knight of the Round Table' })
await knight.save()
// POST /roles

robin.set('role', knight.id)
robin.save()
// PATCH /users/<robin-id>

robin.update()
// GET /users/<robin-id>

robin.runAway()
robin.delete()
// DELETE /users/<robin-id>
```

## Resource Instance Defaults
You can also specify the defaults that a Resource instance should have:

```javascript
class UserResource extends Resource {
    static endpoint = '/users'
    static defaults = {
        name: 'Unknown User',
        weapon: 'Hyperbolic Taunting',
        groups: [1]
    }
}

let unknown = new UserResource({ groups: [2] })
console.log(unknown.get('name'))
// => Unknown User
```

# Working with older versions of Node
If you aren't using a newer version of Node or TypeScript, you can use `Resource.extend` to define static members. For example:
```javascript
const UserResource = Resource.extend({
    endpoint: '/users',
    defaults: {
        name: 'Unknown User'
        // ...etc
    }
})
```

# The `Client` Class
The Client class is a simple request library that is meant to be customized to suit your needs.

#### REST Resource assumes the API you are consuming is rendering JSON and authenticated endpoints are using a Bearer JWT

For requests, REST Resource uses a basic [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) client (`JWTBearerClient` class in `src/client`). You can override this by creating a custom client.

For more information on how Axios works, [please refer to Axios documentation](https://github.com/axios/axios)

## Creating a custom client
When creating a custom client, you can override any methods you'd like. One method in particular you'll need to focus on is `negotiateContent()` which should return a function that parses the body of the response into a list of objects.

## Assigning a Custom Client
There are a number of ways you can set the client:

```javascript
import Resource from 'rest-resource'
import { DefaultClient } from 'rest-resource/dist/client'

class CustomClient extends DefaultClient {
    negotiateContent(ResourceClass) {
        return (response) => {
            let objects = []
            if(Array.isArray(response.data)) {
                response.data.forEach((attributes) => objects.push(new ResourceClass(attributes)))
            } else {
                objects.push(new ResourceClass(response.data))
            }

            return {
                response,
                objects,
                pages: () => response.headers['Pagination-Count'],
                currentPage: () => response.headers['Pagination-Page'],
                perPage: () => response.headers['Pagination-Limit'],
            }
        }
    }
}

class CustomResource extends Resource {
    static client = new CustomClient('http://some-api.com')
}

// Or: (this method can also be used to override client globally by replacing "CustomResource" with "Resource")
CustomResource.client = new CustomClient('http://some-api.com')
```

### JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Authenticated Endpoints
Whenever the user wants to access a protected route or resource, the user agent should send the JWT, typically in the Authorization header using the Bearer schema. The content of the header should look like the following:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

For more information on how JWTs work, please see [JSON Web Token Documentation](https://jwt.io/introduction/)

# Customizing RelatedManager 
Whenever a related field is defined, a manager is created to that field. You can customize this class by extending it and assigning it when you create a class.

```javascript
import Resource from 'rest-resource'
import RelatedManager from 'rest-resource/dist/related'

class CustomRelatedManager extends RelatedManager {
    batchSize: 50 // Only GET 50 related objects at a time (default: Infinity)

    /**
     * @param options Object (getRelated, etc.)
     * @returns Resource[] List of Resource instances
     */
    resolve(options) {
        // etc
    }
}

class UserResource extends Resource {
    static endpoint = '/users'
    // Define custom related manager here
    static RelatedManagerClass = CustomRelatedManager
}
```
